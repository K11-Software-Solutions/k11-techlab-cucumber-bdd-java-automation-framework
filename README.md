# 🧱 K11 TechLab – Cucumber BDD Java Automation Framework

A robust, extensible test automation framework built with **Java**, **Cucumber BDD**, **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, **Appium**, and **REST Assured** — designed for scalable end-to-end testing across web, mobile, and API layers.

This project demonstrates best practices in automation framework architecture, combining modular design, data-driven execution, CI/CD readiness, and comprehensive reporting.

## 🚀 Features

- **Gherkin-Driven Test Design**  
  Write business-readable feature files using Cucumber syntax for UI, API, and mobile scenarios.

- **Page Object Model (POM)**  
  Clean separation of UI page elements and test logic for enhanced reusability and maintainability.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Separate layers for step definitions, utilities, mobile/page objects, runners, and configurations.

- **Data-Driven Testing**  
  Supports scenario outlines and external data sources for flexible test input and logic.

- **Mobile Testing with Appium**  
  Automate Android and iOS native/hybrid apps using Appium drivers integrated into the test suite.

- **REST API Testing with REST Assured**  
  Validate API responses, status codes, and payloads via REST Assured, fully integrated into BDD steps.

- **Parallel Execution**  
  Configure and execute test runs in parallel using TestNG and Maven profiles.

- **Advanced Reporting**  
  Supports Allure Reports, ExtentReports, and Cucumber HTML for detailed and actionable reporting.

- **CI/CD Friendly**  
  Fully compatible with Git, Maven, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions for continuous delivery and testing.
